Diploma project of the educational institution

The project includes 2 programs: a desktop wpf application for employees, as well as a client website

The API application is omitted in this case, it would be an excellent and safe addition to the entire project (not implemented due to lack of time and knowledge to study)
Commits in these projects are sometimes written disgustingly, you should not pay attention to this. Workflow :)
